SM2+ Algorithm from http://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2

For each review-item, store the following data:
difficulty as float from 0.0 to 1.0 (defaults to 0.3) --> high = difficult (value will be 1 if soon clicked)

daysBetweenReviews as float - how many days should occur between review attemps for this item
dateLastReviewed as dateTime - the last time this item was reviewed

Review item length = 10 to 20 items ordered by desc. percentageOverdue
(ignoring items in the past 8 hours)

performaceRating picked by the user 0.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 being the best.
Set a cut-off point for the answer being "correct" (default is 0.6).

Then set 

if correct:
  percentOverdue = Min(2, days(dateNow-dateLastReviewed) / daysBetweenReviews)

if incorrect:
  percentOverdue = 1

difficulty += percentOverdue * 1/17(8-9 *performaceRating), clamp to [0, 1]

difficultyWeight = 3 * 1.7 * difficulty

if correct:
  daysBetweenReviews *= 1 + (difficultyWeight - 1) * percentOverdue

if incorrect:
  daysBetweenReviews *= 1/difficultyWeight^2 (min days = 1) 

- max new cards per day limit e.g. 20 --> not implemented
- max reviews per day e.g. 100 --> needs testing - review count not stored yet
- percentOverdue not used for filtering --> dueDate is easier to work with.
